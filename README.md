# Odin Recipes
The Odin Project: Foundation Recipes Assignment

First Assignment in the "The Odin Project" [Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) where I'll use what I learned in HTML.

# Things I Did Outside of the Requirements:
    - Linking absolute webpages to show sources of the recipes
    - Used nested lists in chicken-biryani.html "Ingredients" part line 41 - 52
    - Opening link in a new tab by adding the attribute target="_blank" 
    - Adding security when opening new websites from my webpage by adding the attribute rel="noopener noreferrer"
    - Used strong, em and footer tag
    - Tried to follow the conventional commits template (I'm not sure if I'm doing it right)
    - Adding alt in images and img folder for file structure
